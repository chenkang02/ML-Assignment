I came to grips that NOBODY cared about me, nobody would miss me if I was gone, and nobody really wanted to listen. It hurt so bad… and I couldn’t live like that anymore. Complete rock bottom. 3rd DWI (which I’m facing right now) and have to do prison time for soon. It was either fight or give up… and I chose to fight. For the first 2 weeks-month I was miserable… I hated working out again. I felt sad doing it, I had almost no focus on the weights I was lifting, could barely run 100 feet without wanting to lay down right there. No matter what I just told myself to finish the workout, and I was just going through the motions. I had to keep my word to myself and do the workout… and it was miserable every single time. I was so sad, but eventually I turned that sadness into anger. Angry that nobody loved me, angry that I wasted 11 years of my life, angry about my legal and health problems… and THAT’S when I started seeing a difference. Once I could feel anger instead of sadness? I started feeling happy. I started looking forward to my workouts. I started to feel motivated to become the best version of myself. Motivation comes and goes, but it is the DEDICATION and DISCIPLINE that gets you to get past that first month. If you are depressed? Please take my advice… workout and exercise. It’s very tough to start with, and you’ll want to quit. But if you push through the pain? You will start seeing a major difference in the quality of your life. 34m and about 120 days into this.\n",
