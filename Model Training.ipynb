She killed herself and left several notes. She explained that she felt like nobody listened because she was ‘dumb’ which she wasnt. She also said she felt like the odd one out since she can remember. She was on antidepressants and she showed no signs of doing something like this anytime soon. Anyways ive struggled with suicidal thoughts and depression since i was 13 so i related to her and what she wrote. Only i related so much i feel like she was maybe the only person who described this feeling ive had for so long. This made me feel like there is no getting better for someone like me. I feel like this is exactly my faith She had 3 kids one of em being 10 yrs. Even children didnt keep her going. I feel like im going to end up exactly the same way as her. So ive decided i wont be having kids since saw and expierenced what it does when kids lose a mom.\n"

Of cours there are also other reasons why I might get depressed but I observed that a constant and main reason is the lack of my partner. It comes periodically every few days or if I am reminded that other ppl have found their partner and I don't. In both cases self-hatred is triggered which makes it much worse (at times I even selfeharmed because of it). When the sadness comes out of nowhere it is often linked with a sort of emptiness, boredom and senslessness. It feels like there is no point in dragging me through those adversities called life, if at the end of the day there is not this one special person waiting for me. In addition my stupid brain decided that it would be a good idea to have a crush on a person who I have barely seen more than a few times from far away. It even came to my mind that it would be a good idea to approach this person in public and ask for their phonenumber. Really really dumb and I am glad that I did not do it. But the longing and the crush still remain.\n",
